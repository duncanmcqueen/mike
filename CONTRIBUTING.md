# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve Mike. Please keep contributions small, focused, and easy to review.

## Guidelines

- Prefer targeted edits over broad refactors.
- Keep each PR focused on one bug, feature, or cleanup.
- Update docs or env examples when changing setup, config, or user-facing behavior.
- Keep self-hosting changes compatible with the supported Docker Compose,
  Supabase, S3-compatible storage, and Ollama paths. Explain any new local
  infrastructure or migration requirements in the same PR.
- Do not commit secrets, API keys, private documents, or local `.env` files.

## Before Opening a PR

- Run the relevant build or test command for the area you changed.
- Check `git diff` and remove unrelated changes.
- Write a concise Markdown PR description with:
    - summary
    - changes
    - why
    - testing

## System Workflows

System workflows live in the sibling
[`Open-Legal-Products/mike-workflows`](https://github.com/Open-Legal-Products/mike-workflows)
repository under `assistant-workflows/` and `tabular-review-workflows/`. Put
structured metadata in the YAML frontmatter at the top of `SKILL.md`, put
workflow instructions in the body of `SKILL.md`, and use `table-columns.yaml`
for tabular review columns.

How workflows reach users:

- **Defaults.** Five hardcoded workflows (`DEFAULT_WORKFLOW_IDS` in
  `backend/src/lib/workflowCatalog.ts`) are installed for every user on first
  use, together with their quick-action settings. Changing which workflows are
  defaults means editing that list — nothing in the workflow repository
  controls it.
- **Add-ons.** Every other workflow in the repository ships in the Add-ons
  catalog. Users import an add-on as an independent, editable copy of the
  workflow.
- **Packs.** A directory with a `pack.yaml` groups its child workflow
  directories into a pack shown together in the catalog. `pack.yaml` must list
  exactly the workflow directories that exist under it — the build fails on
  either a listed-but-missing or an unlisted workflow.
- The `metadata.mike-availability` frontmatter key is deprecated and ignored:
  the default/add-on split comes from `DEFAULT_WORKFLOW_IDS`, not from the
  workflow files. Existing files may keep the key; the generator accepts it
  but never emits it.

After changing system workflows, regenerate the app files:

```bash
node scripts/build-workflows.js
```

The generator stamps the `mike-workflows` commit it read into the generated
files (`SYSTEM_WORKFLOWS_SOURCE_COMMIT`), and CI regenerates from that commit
and fails on any drift — so always commit the regenerated files together with
a workflow change.

## Security

Do not open a public issue for security vulnerabilities. Use [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/Open-Legal-Products/mike/security/advisories/new) instead.

We will aim to respond promptly and coordinate a disclosure timeline with you.

## Local Development

Backend:

```bash
npm run build --prefix backend
```

Frontend:

```bash
npm run build --prefix frontend
```

## Testing

```bash
npm test --prefix backend            # backend unit + route integration tests (vitest)
npm test --prefix frontend           # frontend component/hook tests (vitest + jsdom)
npm run test:e2e                     # Playwright end-to-end suite — see docs/e2e-ci.md
npm run test:stack --prefix backend  # SQLite stack/access tests + gated real-Supabase stack/pagination tests
```

- New features and bug fixes should come with a test at the lowest layer that
  can catch the regression: unit first, then route-level integration, then
  end-to-end only for flows a browser is genuinely needed to prove.
- CI runs the build and unit/integration tests on every PR
  (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`), and the Playwright suite in a full local stack
  (`.github/workflows/e2e.yml`). The CI workflow will also run the optional
  offline eval harness if `evals/run.mjs` is added to the tree.
- Tests that need an LLM key or a live Supabase stack are env-gated and skip
  cleanly when the environment is absent — a plain `npm test` should always be
  green.
